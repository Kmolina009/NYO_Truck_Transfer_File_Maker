TODO
- Create a duplicate of the Dummy_Data- one to test things out, the other for deriving copies
- Either make dicts of the each category excluding the anything past Item Count(I'm sure there's a way to parametize it)
  OR  manipulate the CSV into the categories you'll actually need for this project - Date of Truck, Client Number, Line Item, etc.

- Figuring out where these entires are to be placed.
    -having a script in each file or having a script that designates where an entry will go. Best to Start with the former.
